# Kodie's dotfiles

This is a work in progress. Just some opinionated scripts to get a fresh computer all set up to my liking. Meant to be ran on a Mac.


## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/kodie/dotfiles && cd dotfiles && ./setup.sh
```


## What this currently does

 - Installs [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and uses it to install some packages and applications (see [brew.sh](brew.sh))
 - Configures some macOS settings (see [macos.sh](macos.sh))
 - Installs [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (see [node.sh](node.sh))
 - Installs some [Atom Packages](https://atom.io/packages) (see [atom-packages.txt](atom-packages.txt))

This repo also contains my [.bash_profile](.bash_profile) that should be copied to the home directory (This will be automated soon).
